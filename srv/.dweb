dweb - A simple website written in D
=====
dweb is a simple website framework based off the [werc][werc] software.

Its principles are:

- Database free, uses files and directories instead.
- Written using the D programming language.
- Minimize tedious work: eg., no need to ever write HTML, use markdown instead.
- Very minimalist yet extensible codebase. Handlers for special things should be easy to add.

It was created because werc was annoying to deploy on UW Computer Science Club's Apache setup and because [Not Invented Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_Invented_Here).

Install Guide
------
You will need:
- An HTTP server with CGI support.
- The D compiler.

Extract the contents into the location you want to serve webpages from. Edit the following files:

- <code>$DWEB_ROOT/.htaccess</code>: make the paths work for your setup.
- <code>$DWEB_ROOT/src/config.d</code>: change these strings as necessary.
- <code>$DWEB_ROOT/src/web.d</code>: this is the main web code.
- <code>$DWEB_ROOT/pub/</code>: static content goes here.
- <code>$DWEB_ROOT/srv/</code>: directories, markdown webpages etc. go in here.
- <code>$DWEB_ROOT/bin/</code>: custom handlers go here.

Run <code>build</code> in <code>$DWEB_ROOT/src</code> to recompile the website software.
